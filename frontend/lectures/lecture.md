# Week 2: HTML Basics and Emmet Shortcuts

# Emmet in Visual Studio Code

Emmet is a powerful tool that provides shortcuts and abbreviations for quickly generating HTML and CSS code in various code editors, including Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It can significantly speed up your coding workflow by reducing manual typing. Here are some commonly used Emmet shortcuts:

- `!`: Generates the basic HTML structure.
- `div`: Creates a `<div>` element.
- `p`: Creates a `<p>` element.
- `ul>li*3`: Creates an unordered list with three list items.
- `link:css`: Creates a CSS link tag.
- `img`: Creates an `<img>` element.
- `+` (Adjacent Sibling Selector): The `+` symbol is used to create elements that are placed next to each other as adjacent siblings.
- `>` (Child Selector): The `>` symbol is used to create elements as direct children of another element.
- `a`: Creates an anchor `<a>` element.
- `table>tr*3>td*3`: Creates a table with three rows and three columns.

## Code Example

Let's say you want to create a simple HTML structure with a header, main content, and a footer. Here's how you can use Emmet to generate the code:

1. Open a new HTML file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Type `!` and press the Tab key. It will expand into the basic HTML structure.
3. Inside the `<body>` tag, type `header` and press the Tab key. It will create a `<header>` element.
4. Similarly, type `main` and press the Tab key to create a `<main>` element.
5. Finally, type `footer` and press the Tab key to create a `<footer>` element.

Your code should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header></header>
    <main></main>
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
