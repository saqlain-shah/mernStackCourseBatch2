# MERN Stack Course Repository

Welcome to the **MERN Stack Course** repository presented by Aufklarung and Rinor in Skardu. This repository serves as a central hub for all course materials, code examples, and other helpful resources. It also encourages active participation from trainees by allowing them to push their daily practices and other related content.

## Branches

The repository contains the following branches:

- `main`: The main branch that contains the stable and tested versions of the course materials. Trainees should refer to this branch for the official course content.
- `assigments`: The development branch where trainees can collaborate and push their daily practices, experiments, and other related code. It is the branch for ongoing work and discussions.

## Course Materials

The course materials are organized in a structured manner for easy navigation. Below is an overview of the different directories and files present in this repository:

- **lectures/**: This directory contains all the lecture slides and accompanying notes. Each lecture has its own folder with relevant materials.
- **code-examples/**: Trainees can find various code examples discussed during the lectures or provided as additional resources. These examples can help reinforce the concepts taught in the course.
- **exercises/**: This directory includes exercise files for trainees to practice what they've learned. The exercises are categorized by topic or module, making it easier to find specific practice materials.
- **resources/**: Supplementary resources such as helpful articles, tutorials, and reference guides are placed in this directory. Trainees can explore these materials to deepen their understanding of MERN stack development.
